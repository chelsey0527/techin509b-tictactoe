# techin509b-tictactoe
Starter code for the Tic-Tac-Toe assignments in TECHIN 509B.

## Overview
This repository contains the starter code for the Tic-Tac-Toe assignments in TECHIN 509B. The code includes a simple command-line implementation of the Tic-Tac-Toe game in Python.

## Usage
To play the game, you can run the `cli.py` script. It provides a command-line interface for the game. Two players can take turns making moves on the game board.

## Project Structure
- `cli.py`: The command-line interface for the Tic-Tac-Toe game.
- `logic.py`: Contains the core logic for the Tic-Tac-Toe game.
- `tests.py`: Includes unit tests for the game logic functions.
- `logs/`: A directory for storing game logs and historical data.

## Game Logic
The game logic, including board management, move validation, winner determination, and draw checks, is implemented in `logic.py`. This separation allows for cleaner code organization.

## Unit Tests
The `tests.py` file includes unit tests for the game logic functions. These tests ensure the correctness of the game logic and help maintain code quality.

## Logging
The `/logs` directory is provided to capture game logs and historical data. Logging can be used to record game moves, outcomes, and other relevant information for later analysis.

## Contributions
Contributions to this project are welcome. If you'd like to make improvements or suggest new features, please feel free to submit pull requests or open issues.
